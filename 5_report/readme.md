# **Introduction**
-> The Cricket Scorecard Management System is a very simple project which is programmed using c language. This project uses the method of file handling where the data of runs, name of the players, wickets, strike rates are stored in the file.

-> When the project is executed first of all the welcome screen is displayed with the main menu. The menu will contain three options such as new score sheet, view score sheet and the last one exit.If you pressed 1 then the project asks for the file name where the data will be stored. After creating a file the user starts entering the data and that data is stored in the given file.

->To run this **Cricket Score Management in C** make sure that you have a [**Code Blocks**](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries) or any platform of C installed in your computer.

**Research**

--> The project cricket scorecard developed by c programming is used to provide user with an update of the cricket even when the user is not watching the mach. 

--> Took the idea of the project from some websites of internet and researched on this project.

-->Report generation is easier & Easy to maintain score details.

**Cost and Features and Timeline**

--> This is free of cost project no need to pay to store data and nothing is spended while building the program.

--> The project entitled with "Cricket Score Card Management" is divided into numerous module

->Report generation is easier .

->Easy to maintain score details.

**Defining Our System**

->This **Cricket Score Management System Project in C Language** is a simple console application created using C programming language. It employs file handling to store data such as runs, wickets, overs, and extras, among other things. The program may show runs, wickets, batsman and bowler names, overs, extras, bowler economy, batsman strike rate, and so on. It also shows the game’s start and end time**.**
